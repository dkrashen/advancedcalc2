Syllabus and Course Structure
---

**Welcome to Advanced Calculus 2 !**


Material
---

This is primarily a course in metric spaces, including notions of continuity, limits, and compactness, with a particular emphasis on the study of spaces of functions.
Our main source will be **Basic Analysis I and Basic Analysis II** by J. Lebl, available digitally free of charge at [https://www.jirka.org/ra/](https://www.jirka.org/ra/) or in hardcopy from Amazon [https://amazon.com/dp/1718865481](https://amazon.com/dp/1718865481) and [https://amazon.com/dp/1718862407](https://amazon.com/dp/1718862407).

We will cover roughly the material in chapter 7 of Volume I, and much of Volume II, with an emphasis on the topics towards the end of the book.

Lectures
---

- Lectures will be in person in David Rittenhouse Laboratory
- **Masks are required during lecture**
- In class worksheets will be assigned during most lectures, but can be excused in case you are not able to attend a lecture due to illness or other valid reasons (let me know by email if this happens)
- Lectures will not be recorded, but written notes will be made available within 24 hours of each lecture on the course website

Course Structure
---

- Lectures on Tuesday and Thursdays 3:30-5:00pm in DRL 2C6
- Weekly reading assigned on Thursdays and due the following week on Tuesday
- In class worksheets
- Weekly homework sets assigned on Fridays and due the following week on Fridays (online via canvas/gradescope)
- 3 in class exams during the semester

In the lectures, I will assume that all students have done the assigned reading. I will try to supplement the material by adding extra details and examples as needed.

Grading
---

The course grade will be as follows:

- in class worksheets: 10% total (drop lowest 5)
- weekly assignments: 30% total (drop lowest 3)
- in class exams: 60% total (lowest score counts for 10%, middle score counts for 20%, highest score counts for 30%)

How to be successful
---

To be successful in the course will require:

- Keeping up with readings in the textbook,
- Attending the lectures/discussions
- Keeping up with the written assignments,
- Asking questions via written assignments, email or during office hours whenever something is unclear.

In practical terms, if you want to do well in the course, it is absolutely essential that you keep up with the material in a timely way. Late homework will generally not be accepted.
