Syllabus and Course Structure
---

**Welcome to Advanced Calculus 2 !**


Material
---

This is primarily a course in metric spaces, including notions of continuity, limits, and compactness, as well as the study of spaces of functions.
Our main source will be **Basic Analysis I and Basic Analysis II** by J. Lebl, available digitally free of charge at [https://www.jirka.org/ra/](https://www.jirka.org/ra/) or in hardcopy from Amazon [https://amazon.com/dp/1718865481](https://amazon.com/dp/1718865481) and [https://amazon.com/dp/1718862407](https://amazon.com/dp/1718862407).

We will cover roughly the material in chapter 7 of Volume I, and much of Volume II, with an emphasis on the topics towards the end of the book.

Course Structure
---

Short assignments based on assigned reading will be made available Thursday after lecture and Tuesday evenings, due roughly 24 hours after being posted. These will be primarily graded for completion, and you will have the opportunity here to give feedback on your understanding of the material, so that I know which things are well understood and which things are less clear to everyone. In addition, there will be a standard length weekly homework assignment given out on Tuesday and due Thursday. Finally, once a month we will have longer cumulative homework assignments.

In the lectures, I will assume that all students have done the assigned reading. I will try to supplement the material by adding extra details and examples as needed.

Grading
---

The course grade will be based on these homework assignments as follows:

- semiweekly assignments: 40% total (drop lowest 3)
- weekly assignments: 30% total (drop lowest 2)
- monthly assignments: 30% total (drop lowest 1)

How to be successful
---

To be successful in the course will require:

- Keeping up with readings in the textbook,
- Attending the lectures/discussions
- Keeping up with the written assignments,
- Asking questions via written assignments, email or during office hours whenever something is unclear.

In practical terms, if you want to do well in the course, it is absolutely essential that you keep up with the material in a timely way. Late homework will generally not be accepted.
